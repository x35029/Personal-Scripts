### TO DO (wish list) ### 

processes button - display process start time  

check OU button - "No User account not found in AD reported when "no user" logged in.  

OS check before starting - TSTool supports only server 2008r2 and windows 7

history overwrites if multiple copies of the script are opened - maybe add read from csv before write back

Uninstall button - remove current user registry settings and history temp file and icon.  

add tooltip to coloured connection square - maybe add option to turn tool tips off

SCCM remote control button
