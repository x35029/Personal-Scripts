These notes should get you started with TSTool3
If you encounter any problems, let me know and I will fix it for you.

### Install Notes ###
1. Download the zip file from Technet to get the latest version and associated files.
2. Extract the all the contents into a folder that is centrally accessible on the network.
3. Edit GlobalSettings.csv to reflect your SCCM environment 
4. Email/distribute the path to install.vbs script and instruct the user to run it. 
5. install.vbs will offer the user a custom TSTool3 shortcut on their desktop and start menu.

The idea behind having one central copy of TSTool3 on the network and all users accessing via shortcut, is 
that you only have to update the files in the TSTool3 source folder and all users get a new version when they next launch it. 

The script MUST be launched via shortcut generated via install.vbs to ensure that PowerShell is launched in -sta mode. 





### Usage ###
When TSTool3 is first launched it will display the name of the current computer in the connection box. 
Enter a new computer name or use the history drop down and press enter. 
The enter key conveniently activates the 'Connect' button.

TSTool will perform a connectivity test and update a colour indicator square next to the computer name
. Gray - Disconnected
. Green - Can ping and access WMI 
. Blue - Can ping but WMI time-out or fail
. Red - Off-line

If the connectivity test passes then it will display details of the remote machine and allow remote functions to be run.
TSTool3 will periodically test the connection in case the state of the remote machine is changed.  

If TSTool3 has connectivity issues with a particular remote machine, simply press the disconnect button or close the script. 
Most of the other features are completely visual or self explanatory. 





### Location lookup file ###
TSTool3 will display either the Subnet or the Physical location in the location label. 

When TSTool3 is first run, (you should do this as a user with write access to the TSTool3 source folder), it will create location.csv.
Edit location.csv in Excel and add the physical names that match each of your subnets. 
For large enterprise networks where you have a separate subnet for each floor and many buildings, then this is an invaluable feature. 
If you populate and maintain location.csv, then all TSTool3 users will benefit from real location lookups.


# location.csv structure 

Subnet,Location
"0,0,0,0","Unknown"
"192.168.0.0","Home Network"
"192.168.1.0","Test Network"
"192.168.40.0","Test Network2"


# location.csv Interpretation

Subnet - This is the IPv4 subnet as calculated from the primary IP Address and IP Subnet
Location - This is the Physical location or the description of the Subnet.





### SCCM Settings file ###
TSTool3 supports SCCM. (Only tested SCCM 2012)
Rather than hard code SCCM server settings into TSTool3, this is set via an external file.
Edit GlobalSettings.csv (supplied in the distribution zip) with your SCCM environment settings. 
When TSTool3 starts it looks for this settings file in the same folder where TSTool3.ps1 is saved. 
If you have an SCCM server and have setup GlobalSettings.csv, then you will be able to access the SCCM software reports.
GlobalSettings.csv is also used by the software profile filter GUI to locate the SCCM server.
GlobalSettings.csv file may be updated with additional fields in future versions of TSTool3.


# GlobalSettings.csv structure 

"SCCMServer","SCCMNameSpace"
"SCCM_ServerName","root\sms\site_SC1"


# GlobalSettings.csv field identification

SCCMServer - Your SCCM server
SCCMNameSpace - The WMI NameSpace required to access your SCCM Server database





### Registry User Preference Feature ###
TSTool3 uses the registry to save user preferences.
Currently, The 'Phone number filter' and the history count preferences are saved in the registry. 

To completely remove TSTool3 from the client machine this registry key needs to be deleted. 

# Location used:
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PowerShell\TSTool]

A future release of TSTool3 may have an uninstall option that will delete this key for you. 





### Machine Access History ###
TSTool3 remembers the history of the last ~20 machines accessed by creating a CSV file in the current user's temp folder. 
Under the options menu you can "Set History limit", this is the memory of the last machine you connected to

history.csv has the following fields
"User","Computer","Date"

History may be moved to the registry in a future release.





### Queensland Australia Phone Number Filter ###
Actually this is customised specifically to the Sunshine Coast 07 54 area. 
With the goal in mind of making TSTool3 universal, I have added this as a user preference selectable under the options menu.

Unfortunately due to our phone number fields in AD being populated by the corporate staff phone directory, 
the input is not validated and as a result random alpha numeric strings can be entered by the staff. 

For example: 
Instead of "0754123456", the user may enter "My number is 5412 3456 but dont give to public"
Instead of "0754187654", the user may enter "54187654 Monday to Wednesday"

It is probably useful reading the full blurbs the users put into the phone number field but you may want a nice clean number. 
All our desk phones are IP connected and I can script TSTool3 to initiate a phone call and obviously that will need a clean number.
However we are currently moving to a Lync 2010 setup and I need to do some more research to implement that. 

Therefore, unless by some miracle your network is on the Sunshine Coast too, ignore and leave this feature turned off.
Or if you are enterprising, replace it with your own phone number filter function... 
Or perhaps your phone numbers in AD are validated already, i don't know.  





### Script Update Check ###
Initiated by user clicking a button, the script does a screen scrape of the project's page on Technet. 
If the version published is newer then the script prompts if you would like to view project page. 
If you download the latest version, the distribution zip contains details of changes made. 





### Wake On Lan ###
Prequisites
 User running script needs reporting level access on SCCM server
 Script only wakes up Windows7+ machines and all machines on network need PowerShell Remoting enabled
 Script requires target machine to be in SCCM and correct location recorded (i.e not just moved from another subnet)
 Script requires at least one machine on target subnet to be powered on.
 Script requires target machine to have BIOS setup correctly to accept wakeup packets.
 Script requires target machine plugged into live network and power point 





### Software Profile Filter ###
Tstool has the ability to pull software reports from both SCCM or live direct from the remote machine.
These lists of programs can be long with updates and multiple entries per application so this is the solution.

I have provided a separate GUI that will pull the same reports but offers a mechanism to create a filter list.
Often I will generate a filtered list of apps on a remote machine and notice an new update and then remove it. 
Every subsequent machine I hit will no longer show that item. If you trust all your techs, encourage them to maintain the list too.
